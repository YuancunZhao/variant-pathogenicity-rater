# Next Actions

This file lists the highest-value next tasks for the current project state.
Before starting any task, read `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md`,
`docs/ROADMAP_CURRENT.md`, `docs/KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md`, and
`docs/APPLIED_EVIDENCE_GENERATION.md`. For the current applied evidence status
review, also read `docs/APPLIED_EVIDENCE_STATUS.md`.

## Recommended Next Task

The recommended next task is `62_toy_vcep_profile_validation`.

It is the best next step because the VCEP signal/override framework is now
implemented and validated at the framework level: gene-level VCEP signals,
approved profile overrides, draft/provisional signal-only handling, deprecated
limitation-only handling, profile conflict blocking, batch and annotated-batch
`vcep_profile_summary`, report provenance, and unchanged combiner behavior are
in place. The next constraint is validation depth: toy profiles should prove
profile-off/profile-on behavior and safety boundaries before real provider
validation and a selected real VCEP profile pilot.

## Prioritized Task List

| Task name | Priority | Short summary | Risk level | Expected modules touched | Combiner must remain untouched |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `62_toy_vcep_profile_validation` | P0 | Validate the completed VCEP signal/override framework with toy profiles, profile-off/profile-on examples, report provenance, and batch summaries. | High | Profile fixtures, validation docs, benchmark/report examples | Yes |
| `56_real_provider_validation_clinvar_gnomad_mane_erepo` | P0 | Validate ClinVar, gnomAD, MANE, and ERepo online provider behavior with provenance, local fixtures or opt-in online mode, and failure-to-limitation checks. | High | Provider adapters/fixtures, validation docs, smoke tests, provenance reports | Yes |
| `55_benchmark_expansion` | P1 | Expand the offline benchmark beyond 21 curated cases with rationale, expected applied/candidate/reviewed evidence, literature drafts, and safety checks. | Medium | Data fixtures, benchmark docs, benchmark tests | Yes |
| `57_chinese_report_template` | P1 | Add Chinese report output while preserving human-review-required language, VUS caution, provenance, applied/candidate separation, and reviewed-evidence labeling. | Medium | Reporting templates, docs, report tests | Yes |
| `61_selected_real_vcep_profile_pilot` | P1 | Pilot one selected real VCEP profile only after toy profile and real provider validation pass. | High | Profile config, provenance docs, reports, benchmark cases | Yes |
| `54_vcep_clingen_rule_knowledge_base` | Done | Implemented lightweight versioned VCEP signal/override framework with explicit profile selection, safe override surface, provenance, reporting, and batch summaries. | High | Profile docs/config schemas, evidence generator inputs, reports, CLI/MCP, batch | Yes |
| `clingen_erepo_integration_validation` | Done | Validated ClinGen ERepo as a conservative curated-source review-note and reviewed-draft integration with no automatic application. | High | ERepo provider, reviewed drafts, reports, CLI/MCP, docs, tests | Yes |
| `52_manual_reviewed_evidence_workflow` | Done | Implemented explicit curator-reviewed evidence input with strict validation, provenance, batch/CLI/MCP support, and no silent candidate promotion. | High | Input schemas, validation, provenance, reports, batch, CLI, MCP, docs, tests | Yes |
| `53_literature_suggested_evidence_review_workflow` | Done | Implemented literature suggested-evidence to reviewed-draft workflow; drafts default to needs-more-info and require curator edits before reviewed_applied use. | High | Literature agent, suggestion schemas, reviewed draft tool, CLI/MCP, reports, docs, tests | Yes |
| `51_clinvar_and_ps1_pm5_generation` | Done | Implemented conservative ClinVar-derived PS1/PM5 applied generator with candidate-only fallbacks and no PP5/BP6 reuse. | Medium-high | ClinVar comparator workflow, reports, CLI/MCP serialization, docs, focused tests | Yes |
| `legacy_vcep_profile_design` | Superseded by `54_vcep_clingen_rule_knowledge_base` | Design explicit disease/gene-specific VCEP profile configuration before implementation. | High | Design docs, schema proposal, roadmap docs | Yes for design; any later implementation needs explicit impact review |
| `58_release_review_standardization` | P2 | Convert release review into a repeatable checklist-driven gate tied to docs, benchmarks, smoke, provenance, and leakage checks. | Low-medium | Docs, release notes template, optional scripts later | Yes |
| `59_provider_provenance_audit` | P3 | Audit all provider outputs for source version, query, snapshot, timestamps, limitations, and offline/online mode labels. | Medium | Provider adapters, schemas, reports, docs, tests | Yes |
| `60_batch_report_consistency_audit` | P3 | Verify single, batch, annotated-batch, CLI, and MCP outputs preserve the same evidence separation and safety language. | Medium | Batch orchestration, reports, CLI/MCP output tests, docs | Yes |

## Guardrails For Selecting Work

Prefer tasks that strengthen safety, reviewability, provenance, and validation.
Avoid tasks that broaden variant scope or automate strong evidence without the
required clinical context.

Do not start CNV/SV, repeat, mitochondrial, methylation, trio/family-aware,
wet-lab/RNA, or clinical sign-out tasks as implementation work in the current
stage. Those belong in design or future validated tracks.
